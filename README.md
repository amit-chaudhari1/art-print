# Art print

A factorio utility that allows folks to convert images to factorio's ingame blueprints. 

These blueprints are not meant to be traversed upon. unless you are within a spider tron. 

I want to update the mapping and make it so that player/users can create blueprints that include concrete only.

## Installation and usage

`cargo build` and run the binaries in target like `./target/debug/factorio-printer example.jpg`
and it will generate the blueprint code in a text file within `./targe/debug/`
